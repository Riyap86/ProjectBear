        <p>Grizzly bears, though widely known, are just one example of endangered animals. When the country was first explored by Lewis and Clark, the grizzly bears'
        habitat was destroyed by land development, mining, and oil drilling. Threats to key resources used by grizzly bears along with habitat destruction have impacted the
        bears for many years. Over the years, the reproduction rates for the grizzly bears have also decreased significantly. Additional global warming threats have also
        negatively impacted the bear communities. It has caused them to den later in the fall, making them prone to human-caused mortalities. Global warming also causes
        the bears' resources to decrease. These different factors have made it increasingly difficult for grizzly bears to stay safe. While their numbers are slowly increasing
        now, bears are still struggling in Idaho, Montana, and the Cascades.

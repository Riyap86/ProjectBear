        <p style="text-align: center">Hello! Welcome to my web application: Save Your Fav! This website is dedicated to spreading awareness of various
        endangered species and encouraging a wider audience to donate and help save these precious animals. The pictures above are of just a few endangered species.
        Globally, there are approximately 41,415 endangered species today (Kasnoff). These animals are suffering as a result of various environmental and human
        factors and are in danger of being extinct. It is critical that we, as humans, begin to increase our focus on pivotal matters such as saving various species
        that are struggling to continue living safely in their own habitats. The first step to saving more animals is making more people aware of the issue.</p>

        <p>Feel free to browse through my web application to learn more about endangered species throughout the world. I hope you learn something new today!</p>
